- ðŸ”­ I am a PhD candidate in CS at [Univ. of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/), majorly focusing on high-performance computing.
- ðŸŒ± I am taking an internship with [Intel Corp](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) doing development and optimization for homomorphic encryptions on Intel GPUs.
- âš¡ More about myself: I was from a non-CS background. I completed undergraduate studies in Organic Chemistry at [Univ of Sci and Tech of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), a beloved college sitting in Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China. After which, I went to the US and switched to Theoretical and Computational Chemistry in the PhD program at [Duke Univ](https://duke.edu/). Quickly realizing I might be more interested in CS, I moved again so now I am a PhD student in CS.
